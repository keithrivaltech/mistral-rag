Typica Coffee Varietal Overview

Origin & History
----------------
- Typica is one of the oldest and most genetically pure Arabica coffee lineages.
- It originated in Ethiopia and was spread to Yemen, then to India, Indonesia, and finally the Americas by European colonists in the 18th century.
- Typica is the genetic base for many other Arabica varieties including Bourbon.

Geographic Distribution
-----------------------
- Grown across Latin America, Asia (notably Indonesia), and parts of Africa.
- Especially prominent in Jamaica (Blue Mountain), Hawaii (Kona), and parts of Central America.

Agronomic Characteristics
--------------------------
- Plant Type: Tall stature with large, bronze-tipped leaves and elongated cherries.
- Yield: Relatively low compared to modern hybrids.
- Growth Conditions: Performs best at 1,200–2,000 meters elevation in cool, tropical climates.
- Disease Susceptibility: Highly vulnerable to coffee leaf rust and other pests, which limits its widespread cultivation today.

Flavor Profile
--------------
- Taste: Known for excellent cup quality—sweet, clean, and complex.
- Notes: Often features floral and citrus tones, with crisp acidity and a smooth body.
- Acidity: Delicate and refined.

Role in Coffee Breeding
------------------------
- One of the two progenitor varieties of nearly all Arabica cultivars (alongside Bourbon).
- Foundational in breeding programs for its purity and high cup quality.

Cultivation Considerations
---------------------------
- Due to disease vulnerability and low yield, often replaced by hybrids, though still prized in specialty markets.
- Requires careful attention to crop health and processing to realize its full potential.

Castillo Coffee Varietal Overview

Origin & History
----------------
- Castillo was developed by Cenicafé (Colombian National Coffee Research Center) and released in 2005.
- It was created as a replacement for Caturra, which had been devastated by coffee leaf rust.
- Castillo is a result of a breeding program that crossed Caturra with the Timor Hybrid.

Geographic Distribution
-----------------------
- Extensively planted in Colombia, now covering more than half of the country’s coffee-growing area.
- Also gaining interest in other Latin American countries for its resistance traits.

Agronomic Characteristics
--------------------------
- Plant Type: Medium height with compact foliage and short internodes.
- Yield: High and consistent, especially under managed conditions.

Flavor Profile
--------------
- Taste: Variable depending on elevation and processing; typically balanced and clean.
- Notes: Can include caramel, red fruit, citrus, and herbal qualities, especially in high-elevation lots.
- Acidity: Moderate with medium body.

Role in Coffee Breeding
------------------------
- Represents a new wave of rust-resistant varieties that prioritize both disease resilience and cup quality.
- Continues to influence breeding programs focused on sustainable production and climate resilience.
